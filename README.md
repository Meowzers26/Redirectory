# Redirectory
Redirect all YouTube searches to one specific video

Current goal: Have YouTube searches redirect to a video essay of my choosing (or a rickroll. Whichever I feel like)

Future goal: Redirect unproductive / social media links to a random Wikipedia article

Future future goal: Redirect link of the user's choosing to a link of the user's choosing. Hopefully in a user-friendly way
